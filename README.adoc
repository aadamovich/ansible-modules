= Ansible Modules

This repository contains some Ansible modules that I wrote earlier.

If you like some module and you want to merge it into the upstream, then feel free to do it.
But please, do not make me involved.
I was contributing to Ansible earlier, but not anymore.


== List of Modules

link:library/database/ldap.py[ldap]::
  This module adds, modifies and removes entries in LDAP server, similarly as `ldapmodify` command.

link:library/database/mongodb_replset.py[mongodb_replset]::
  This module allows to initiate a new replica set or add new members to an existing one.
  It canâ€™t remove members from a replica set, this should be always done with caution by hand.

link:library/database/postgresql_exec.py[postgresql_exec]::
  This module is intended for initializing database schema and maybe populating with some seed data from a SQL script.
  However, it can be used to execute any SQL commands.
  It is up to the user to maintain idempotence.
